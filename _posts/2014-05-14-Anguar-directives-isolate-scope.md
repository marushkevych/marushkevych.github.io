Angular documentation for Isolate Scope Properties `@`, `=`, and `&` was always very confusing but now its also hard to find.
They replaced it with [gentle introduction](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive). 
So the actual [in-depth guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile) is moved to API Reference for $compile service.
