Scala is one of those languages (for me at least) that need constant use in order to stay in my had. 
I completed "Functional programming in Scala" course more then year ago, doing pretty advance stuff in Scala, 
but now going back to it i found lots of gaps in my Scala part of the brain.

There a lots of resources on the net, but for me this book is the best way to refresh my scala: 
[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)

Here I'll document the most helpful reminders...
