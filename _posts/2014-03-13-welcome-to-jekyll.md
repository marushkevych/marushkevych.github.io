I decided to use Jekyll to power my personal site/blog, since github is already using it to generate its static sites.
Jekyll's docs could be little overwhelming. For example it was not too obvious that you can use markdown for regular pages, 
not only blog entries. Simply add a file with  `.md` extention and Jekyll will generate `.html` file. Pretty cool!

The best way to start is to generate example site with `jekyll new` command.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info.
